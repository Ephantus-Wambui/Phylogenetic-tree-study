Estimating Phylogenetic trees using six microorganisms 16S rRNA gene with Unsupervised Learning, web based tools and Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis MEGA7

Setting up your environment
---
* Download Anaconda for your operating system for Python 3 [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
* Create a conda environment like mine:

  `conda env create -f environment.yml`

  This creates an environment called py35. Activate it with this command in your terminal

  `source activate py35`

* In your terminal, in the directory where you cloned this repository. Run this command

  `jupyter notebook Phylogenetic_trees_unsupervised_learning.ipynb`

I've not provided a codebook/data description file since one of the headings cover that in the notebook.
Otherwise, you can check out the [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Shuyib/Phylogenetic-tree-study/blob/master/Phylogenetic_trees_unsupervised_learning.ipynb) or the HTML file i've provided in the repository.
