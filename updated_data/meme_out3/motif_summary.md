The most common motif, we found between the sequences had the follow pattern **ATGTGGTTTAATTCGATGCAACGCGAAGAACCTTACCTGGTCTTGACATC**. The highest number of occurences were from *Lupinus albus* which is a flowering plant. It is fascinating that we found not only this one but also, *Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris* and *Gossypium* sp. These eukaryotes could be distant relatives of the microbes we used in our samples which is fascinating discovery. The subsitution matrix used was BLOSUM 80 which gives aligments of mostly evolutionary close organisms that is, homogolous. However, we got even more hits when using BLOSUM 62, therefore, the plant hits are significant. This might be a Paralogous gene.

Otherwise, moving to the more important section, the function. Using the function <df.Description.value_counts(normalize=True)> using pandas. We get alot of descriptions with then begin **Uncharacterized proteins** from microbes such as *Streptococcus criceti* & *Collinsella sp. An271*. The single hits from specific microbe species like *Ideonella* gaves us a clue that this, could be Integral membrane protein which could be something look into. On the other hand, the mechanism of action of antibiotics attack the membranes too. We also, got sequences from fungi, *Hortaea werneckii* mostly corresponding to SH3 domain-containing protein(Fragment) and H3 domain-containing protein. For prior, it could be associated again with [intracellular and membrane-associated proteins](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/InterPro/IPR001452/).

In summary, I feel that we should look at the results from the other hits we got and see if there's a pattern we can learn. However, this region could be annotated better so that we can either manipulate it with CRISPR cas9 or inhibit the motif to see the effect on these resistant microbes.
