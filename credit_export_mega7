Figure. Molecular Phylogenetic analysis by Maximum Likelihood method
The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Jukes-Cantor model [1]. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 500 replicates [3] is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed [3]. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (500 replicates) are shown next to the branches [3]. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the Maximum Composite Likelihood (MCL) approach, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. The analysis involved 6 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were 1st+2nd+3rd+Noncoding. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 656 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA7 [2].
